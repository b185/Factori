Testing procedure:
There are three files:
  1) Tasks.txt
  2) TasksPriorities.txt
  3) TasksCompleted.txt
  
In order to initiate the program upon the tasks listed in "Tasks.txt" according to the priorities listed in "TasksPriorities.txt", one will enter the following command to
Command Prompt:

"Factori.exe <"Tasks.txt" path> <"TasksCompleted.txt" path> <Number of tasks> <number of threads - up to 63>"


The solution will be written to the end of "Tasks.txt" when the program finishes running.
"TasksCompleted.txt" is the same as the output "Tasks.txt" when a single thread is used and is meant for validation the program's operation, thus, 
the order in which the tasks' solutions are enlisted in itis according to the priorities in "TasksPriorities.txt".
